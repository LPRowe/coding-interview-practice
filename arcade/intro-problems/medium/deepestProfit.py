You have deposited a specific amount of money into your bank account. 
Each year your balance increases at the same growth rate. With the assumption 
that you don't make any additional deposits, find out how long it would take 
for your balance to pass a specific threshold.

Example

For deposit = 100, rate = 20, and threshold = 170, the output should be
depositProfit(deposit, rate, threshold) = 3.

Each year the amount of money in your account increases by 20%. So throughout 
the years, your balance would be:

year 0: 100;
year 1: 120;
year 2: 144;
year 3: 172.8.

Thus, it will take 3 years for your balance to pass the threshold, so the 
answer is 3.

Input/Output

[execution time limit] 4 seconds (py3)

[input] integer deposit

The initial deposit, guaranteed to be a positive integer.

Guaranteed constraints:
1 ≤ deposit ≤ 100.

[input] integer rate

The rate of increase. Each year the balance increases by the rate percent of 
the current sum.

Guaranteed constraints:
1 ≤ rate ≤ 100.

[input] integer threshold

The target balance.

Guaranteed constraints:
deposit < threshold ≤ 200.

[output] integer

The number of years it would take to hit the threshold.
