Given a string, find out if its characters can be rearranged to form a palindrome.

Example

For inputString = "aabb", the output should be
palindromeRearranging(inputString) = true.

We can rearrange "aabb" to make "abba", which is a palindrome.

Input/Output

[execution time limit] 4 seconds (py3)

[input] string inputString

A string consisting of lowercase English letters.

Guaranteed constraints:
1 â‰¤ inputString.length â‰¤ 50.

[output] boolean

true if the characters of the inputString can be rearranged to form a 
palindrome, false otherwise.

thoughts:
    
this one seems faily straight forward:

1) check each character to see if it occurs an even number of times
2) up to 1 character may occur an odd numer of times
