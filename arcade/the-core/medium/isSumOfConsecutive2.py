Find the number of ways to express n as sum of some (at least two) consecutive positive integers.

Example

For n = 9, the output should be
isSumOfConsecutive2(n) = 2.

There are two ways to represent n = 9: 2 + 3 + 4 = 9 and 4 + 5 = 9.

For n = 8, the output should be
isSumOfConsecutive2(n) = 0.

There are no ways to represent n = 8.

Input/Output

[execution time limit] 4 seconds (py3)

[input] integer n

A positive integer.

Guaranteed constraints:
1 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 104.

[output] integer
